# My Topic Google Doodle

For my google doodle I decided to do a fruit theme. Not only is fruit fun and delicious, but it also has a round feel that matches the roundness of the google logo. The fruit is supposed to encapsulate the energy change as we head towards the warmer seasons of spring and summer. Plus who doesn't like fruit?
